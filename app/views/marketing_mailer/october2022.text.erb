Have an idea for feature that would make Hotseat better? Want real experience on a production web application?

This fall, Hotseat is teaming up with UCLA DevX to open up Hotseat development to UCLA students.

Our tech stack includes Ruby on Rails, React/d3/Typescript, and serverless Go lambda functions hosted on AWS. We talk more about our technologies and architecture here: https://blog.hotseat.io/posts/tech-talk/.

You’ll have the opportunity to work on impactful Hotseat features such as:

- Adding GE info to course pages (https://github.com/hotseatio/hotseat.io/issues/1)
- Allowing users to upvote/downvote reviews (https://github.com/hotseatio/hotseat.io/issues/2)
= Allowing users to set their majors and minors (https://github.com/hotseatio/hotseat.io/issues/2)

No prior technical experience is required and all majors are welcome. We’ll teach you the ins and outs of production web development through several training sessions throughout the quarter, plus you’ll get specialized mentorship through pair programming sessions with the founders of Hotseat.

Apply now through DevX (https://www.ucladevx.com/recruitment). The deadline is 10/9/2022.
