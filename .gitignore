# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal
/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*

# are not checked in

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
