# MIME::Types is a registry of MIME types. It is both a class (created with
# MIME::Types.new) and a default registry (loaded automatically or through
# interactions with MIME::Types.[] and MIME::Types.type_for).
#
# == The Default mime-types Registry
#
# The default mime-types registry is loaded automatically when the library
# is required (<tt>require 'mime/types'</tt>), but it may be lazily loaded
# (loaded on first use) with the use of the environment variable
# +RUBY_MIME_TYPES_LAZY_LOAD+ having any value other than +false+. The
# initial startup is about 14× faster (~10 ms vs ~140 ms), but the
# registry will be loaded at some point in the future.
#
# The default mime-types registry can also be loaded from a Marshal cache
# file specific to the version of MIME::Types being loaded. This will be
# handled automatically with the use of a file referred to in the
# environment variable +RUBY_MIME_TYPES_CACHE+. MIME::Types will attempt to
# load the registry from this cache file (MIME::Type::Cache.load); if it
# cannot be loaded (because the file does not exist, there is an error, or
# the data is for a different version of mime-types), the default registry
# will be loaded from the normal JSON version and then the cache file will
# be *written* to the location indicated by +RUBY_MIME_TYPES_CACHE+. Cache
# file loads just over 4½× faster (~30 ms vs ~140 ms).
# loads.
#
# Notes:
# * The loading of the default registry is *not* atomic; when using a
#   multi-threaded environment, it is recommended that lazy loading is not
#   used and mime-types is loaded as early as possible.
# * Cache files should be specified per application in a multiprocess
#   environment and should be initialized during deployment or before
#   forking to minimize the chance that the multiple processes will be
#   trying to write to the same cache file at the same time, or that two
#   applications that are on different versions of mime-types would be
#   thrashing the cache.
# * Unless cache files are preinitialized, the application using the
#   mime-types cache file must have read/write permission to the cache file.

# == Usage
#  require 'mime/types'
#
#  plaintext = MIME::Types['text/plain']
#  print plaintext.media_type           # => 'text'
#  print plaintext.sub_type             # => 'plain'
#
#  puts plaintext.extensions.join(" ")  # => 'asc txt c cc h hh cpp'
#
#  puts plaintext.encoding              # => 8bit
#  puts plaintext.binary?               # => false
#  puts plaintext.ascii?                # => true
#  puts plaintext.obsolete?             # => false
#  puts plaintext.registered?           # => true
#  puts plaintext.provisional?          # => false
#  puts plaintext == 'text/plain'       # => true

  # Returns a list of MIME::Type objects, which may be empty. The optional
  # flag parameters are <tt>:complete</tt> (finds only complete MIME::Type
  # objects) and <tt>:registered</tt> (finds only MIME::Types that are
  # registered). It is possible for multiple matches to be returned for
  # either type (in the example below, 'text/plain' returns two values --
  # one for the general case, and one for VMS systems).
  #
  #   puts "\nMIME::Types['text/plain']"
  #   MIME::Types['text/plain'].each { |t| puts t.to_a.join(", ") }

  #   MIME::Types[/^image/, :complete => true].each do |t|
  #     puts t.to_a.join(", ")
  #   end
  #
  # If multiple type definitions are returned, returns them sorted as
  # follows:
  #   1. Complete definitions sort before incomplete ones;
  #   2. IANA-registered definitions sort before LTSW-recorded
  #      definitions.
  #   3. Current definitions sort before obsolete ones;
  #   4. Obsolete definitions with use-instead clauses sort before those
  #      without;
  #   5. Obsolete definitions use-instead clauses are compared.
  #   6. Sort on name.
